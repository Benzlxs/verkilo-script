# verkilo-script

This is a private script using Pandoc to use GitHub / Markdown to make books.

**Verkilo** is a brief Ruby script that wraps around Pandoc that converts Markdown files into books. Use with **[Verkilo-Master](https://github.com/Merovex/verkilo-master)** as a template to create your own book.

## Philosophy

Novel writing should focus on the content, and let the formatting take care of itself. I believe in leveraging open-source to the extent practical. Since large-form fiction writing is straight text, Markdown is ideal. This may not be as well suited for non-fiction that relies heavily on tables. Provided the images are the right size (300 DPI), they should work fine.

## Features

* Consolidates a (nested) Directory of Markdown files (*.md) into a single document in the following formats:
  - PDF - Creates a PDF leveraging LaTeX book format (not memoir).
  - ePUB - Creates an ePUB which can then be converted into MOBI for Kindle.
  - HTML - Creates a single-page HTML document for easy browser reading.
  - DOCX - Creates a Microsoft Word Document that most editors prefer.

## Installation

To install **Verkilo**:

1. Create directory `~/.verkilorc`
2. Move `templates` directory into `~/.verkilorc` (`~/.verkilorc/templates`)
3. Install Pandoc (see dependencies)
4. Copy verkilo to a bin directory of your choosing in your `$PATH`. (I use `~/bin`, but could be `/usr/local/bin`) and ensure it has execute permissions (`chmod +x verkilo`)

### Dependencies

* All code written in Ruby
* Requires [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/).

## Usage

To use Verkilo:
* `verkilo pdf great-national-novel`  creates a PDF against the great-national-novel directory.
* `verkilo epub great-national-novel`  creates an ePUB against the great-national-novel directory.
* `verkilo html great-national-novel`  creates an HTML page against the great-national-novel directory.
* `verkilo docx great-national-novel`  creates a Word doc against the great-national-novel directory.

The formatted documents will be dropped into the `build/` directory.

## Configuration

**Verkilo** allows for some configuration using [YAML](https://yaml.org/). This is accomplished in one of two ways:

1. If you are writing multiple books (i.e., a series) that will share configurations, you put those into a `metadata.yml` file in the root directory.
2. For metadata related to a specific book in that series, you can put those as Frontmatter in any of the Markdown files, or as a dedicated Markdown file.

### Trimsize

The PDF option includes multiple trim sizes, depending on your target form factor. The Word document has a fixed trim size (Letter). The ePUB and HTML lack trim sizes.

|   Trimsize       |  Paper Size   |  I/O Margins  | T/B Margins |
|        ---       |      ---      |      ---      |     ---     |
| **AFourSize**    | 210mm x 297mm |          2cm  |        2cm  |
| **Letter**       |  8.5" x 11"   |          1.0" |       1.0"  |
| **USTrade**      |    6" x 9"    |   7/8" x 5/8" | 5/8" x 5/8" |
| **Digest**       |  5.5" x 8.5"  |   7/8" x 5/8" | 7/8" x 7/8" |
| **USSmallTrade** | 5.25" x 8"    |   7/8" x 5/8" | 7/8" x 7/8" |
| **Novella**      |    5" x 8"    |   3/4" x 5/8" | 7/8" x 6/8" |
| **MassMarket**   | 4.25" x 7"    |   3/4" x 5/8" | 7/8" x 7/8" |
| **UKAFormat**    | 111mm x 178mm |   20mm x 16mm | 22mm x 22mm |
| **UKBFormat**    | 129mm x 198mm |   20mm x 16mm | 22mm x 22mm |

* I/O Margins - This is the inner & outer margin. The inner margin adds the gutter necessary for the binding.
* T/B Margins - This is the top & bottom margin. The top margin includes the header.
